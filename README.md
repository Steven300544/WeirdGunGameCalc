Made using c++ this tool reads data from Data/FullData.json and tries out all possible combinations. 
Currently to use it you have to modify the source code yourself ðŸ’€, but this may change in the future.

## Data 
The data it reads is the output of `FileFormatter.py` that formats the .txt files in RawData provided by @zyadak.

## Runtime
It takes around 4-6 minutes to bruteforce all combinations currently but there are plans to optimize this further.

## Interesting Builds
I will try to keep this directory updated with any builds that the program spits out as interesting. 

## Compilation
I have no idea how to use cmake so...
```sh
g++ -Iinclude Caculator.cpp -o Calculator
./Calculator > Results.txt
```
